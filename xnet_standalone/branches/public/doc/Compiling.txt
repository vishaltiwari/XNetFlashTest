Compiling Instructions for XNet 6.0_public
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XNet use the make utility to build the xnet executable.  The Makefile contains the 
build rules for numerous variants of xnet.  The Makefile, which is the same on all 
platforms, relies on a number of definitions in Makefile_local for localization.  
These include the names of the compilers, common sets of compiler options, etc.  
Sample Makefile_locals are included for gfortran and the Intel FORTRAN compiler, 
ifort.  This covers most new users of XNet and provides examples for users on other 
platforms to create their own.

Building instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Downloading the XNet_public.zip files 
2) Unzipping the XNet_public.zip which will create a branches directory containing a 
public sub-directory.  This is the root directory of XNet.
3) Change directory to branches/public/source.
4) Create Makefile_local by copying and editing one of the examples of Makefile_local
5) make

Choice of Compilers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If users have a choice of compilers, there can be considerable differences in 
performance when XNet is optimized by different compilers.  Code performance becomes 
more important as the size of the nuclear network grows.  In general, gfortran, 
which is freely available for virtually all platforms, builds the slowest execution.  
A more important performance difference comes from the choice of matrix solver, see 
Matrix_Solver.txt for more discussion.
