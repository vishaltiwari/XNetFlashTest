Troubleshooting Instructions for XNet 6.0_public
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most common errors come from errors in the input of the initial
abundances or thermodynamic trajectory.  By default the network is
configured to output to the screen the time, Temp. and density for each
timestep.  Check that these are correct.  

If you see an error message which begins,
"Time beyond thermodynamic range" ...
Then the current time (and the Stop time) is larger than the last time value 
in the thermo trajectory.  Check to see that the time and stop time values in 
your thermo input file are being read in correctly.  Also check that the
parameter nhmx (in the thermo_data module in conditions.f90) is larger than the
number of lines in your thermo input file.

If the network runs for many steps then dies, reporting a floating point error, 
then you've probably reached too low a temperature for the network to run.
The temperature at which problems occur depends strongly on the choice of 
reactions and the number of isotopes.
