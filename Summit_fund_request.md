These are all the things relavant to xnet:

- The underlying mathematical formulation (e.g., ODE, PDE).

- Particular libraries required by the simulation and analysis software, algorithms and numerical techniques employed (e.g., finite element, iterative solver), programming languages, and other software used.
  - Libraries:
    - LAPACK
    
  - numerical techniques employed:
    - BDF integrator
    - Jacobi iterative method
  - Programming languages:
    - Fortran
    - Python
    - C/C++
  - other software:
  
- Parallel programming model(s) used (e.g., MPI, OpenMP, Pthreads, CUDA, OpenACC).
  - MPI, OpenACC, CUDA, OpenMP
 
- Project workflow, including the role of analysis and visualization and the availability of checkpoint and restart files.

- I/O requirements (e.g., amount, size, bandwidth, etc) for restart, analysis, and workflow. Highlight any exceptional I/O needs.
